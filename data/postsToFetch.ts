      text: `Hello Reddit, it's me Jon Stewart. You know me. I'm Adam Sandler's friend from Big Daddy. Or maybe you know me from the popcorn gif, which according to leading internet historians, comes from something called The Daily Show which I allegedly hosted for 16 years (but the popcorn gif is the only remaining proof). Now I host The Problem with Jon Stewart on Apple TV And sometimes I go to Congress and try to shame elected officials into showing a baseline of humanity. Today we're discussing the problem with the Stock Market…Ask me anything!!

         "Hey Reddit! This is Jon Stewart. Thank you so much for the opportunity to join you today. I don't pretend to understand the nuances between the different Wall Street communities here and I'm certainly not an expert in the intricacies of trading but I am a firm believer in clear, fairer, more transparent markets. I imagine I'll get more out of this today than you all will but I welcome the chance to have the discussion and hopefully whatever animosities exist in these communities that have made a group discussion here impossible, will be minimized towards this higher goal. But if not, know I'll be watching with my very own eating popcorn GIF.",

         "That's a lot of money to repaint all those trucks, that was a commitment",
         `Sorry, let me rephrase: historically they have been white. Most still are. This one was just outside of my shop this morning. I am hoping that all future trucks are this color.`,
         `Even if this truck was scheduled to be repainted it is harder to repaint with a different color since you have to be extra careful. During a normal respray it does not matter so much if you miss a spot or if the paint end up a bit uneven. The base layer will not show up next to the final coat. However when you are changing color any imperfection will cause the base layer to shine through and be very visible. So a change in color was not free. The two shades also adds a bit to the complexity of the job increasing the cost of the respray.`,
         `That is not a bad idea. I do see some stickers are already reapplied but those are the required ones. I was going to comment on it being on its side for it to be a flag, which does make it a bit easier to paint. But if they already had that in a proposed paint scheme then it is probably lucky for them.`,

These groups have been described as being encouraged to commit aggressive acts against their rival teams Barras (and I assume any casual fans caught wearing the opposite teams colors). I've read some people say that these Barras have gotten training from their South American counterparts but I'm not sure about the veracity of that claim yet. There have been Facebook screenshots Querétaro fans posting allusions to a brawl before the March started as well.",
