Or maybe you know me from the popcorn gif, which according to leading internet historians, comes from something called The Daily Show which I allegedly hosted for 16 years (but the popcorn gif is the only remaining proof). Now I host The Problem with Jon Stewart on Apple TV And sometimes I go to Congress and try to shame elected officials into showing a baseline of humanity. Today we're discussing the problem with the Stock Market…Ask me anything!!

I imagine I'll get more out of this today than you all will but I welcome the chance to have the discussion and hopefully whatever animosities exist in these communities that have made a group discussion here impossible, will be minimized towards this higher goal.

However when you are changing color any imperfection will cause the base layer to shine through and be very visible. So a change in color was not free.
